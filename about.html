                    Hi, I'm Emily, a tools and gameplay programmer and a BSc Games Development graduate from Staffordshire University! I'm a programmer with knowledge in C++, C# with Unity, Unreal Engine Blueprint, and Python.
                    <br /><br />
                    During my studies, I intend to develop my skills in C++ for use with Unreal Engine, and continue working on my own personal projects to ensure I keep my existing skills sharp and up to date.
                    <br /><br />I occasionally make simple Discord bots, and have experience in the industry as a Tools Programmer.

        <h2>Experience:</h2>
        <h3>Staffsverse at Staffordshire University, June-July 2022</h3>
        <h4>Junior Gameplay Programmer</h4>
        <p>
            I worked as a junior programmer on Staffsverse, a 3D recreation of the university set on Mars. Working in the initial team for just over a month in June and July 2022, I had the opportunity to work on the collectable items hidden throughout the game,
            with additional code to allow it to work with multiplayer, and a wiring minigame requiring symbols to be matched. I had zero experience with Unreal Engine 5 previous to the role, but worked well with my team to produce a working final product that
            integrated with other systems developed during the period.
        </p>
        <h3>Associate Engineer at Playground Games, July 2023 - October 2024</h3>
        <h4>Associate Engineer</h4>
        <p>
            I spent a year on placement, working at Playground Games as an Associate Engineer on the Tools Team. In this role, I worked with others on the project to improve and iterate on existing tooling with new functionality and bugfixes, while
            ensuring that my work is maintainable elsewhere within the engine. This required me to communicate with stakeholders from various disciplines to design and implement tooling to aid with development. I found this was a really useful experience to have
            so early on, and gave me a good impression of the industry as a whole.
