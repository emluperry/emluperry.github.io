            A purely C++ recreation of Pacman using the S2D library. This project was developed over the course of my first semester while learning and using C++ and S2D, a library based on OpenGL and OpenAL, for the first time.

        </div>
        <p>
            I used an external text file to edit each level's walls and dot placements by loading it into the game as a vector of characters, x, o, O and '.', with each character representing a wall, a dot, a power pellet, or empty space. This vector was then used to generate different instances of a struct for each potential object, which kept track of its own position, texture and collision. This allowed me to dynamically alter levels to have a different layout, different dot and pellet placements, and overall, different maze layouts.

            The game also features a basic high score system, using input into the console, which is stored in an external file and can be loaded into the game once closed and reopened. The game compares the player's current score with the last value in the high score file to determine whether the table needs to be updated. Then, it takes an input for the player's name, and updates the stored table with the new score.

        <p>
            The ghosts each follow a pathfinding AI, based on a target position calculated differently for each ghost to create different behaviours. Whenever a ghost determines that it has reached an intersection through a simple raycast system that checks for collisions, it will determine which path would take it closer to it's target position, and take that path. The red ghost will always target Pacman; the pink ghost targets a position a few paces in front of Pacman; the blue ghost targets a position in line with Pacman and the red ghost; the orange ghost targets Pacman until it gets too close, at which point it retreats. All ghosts also have their own 'home' position that they will retreat to using the same system upon activating the power pellet.
